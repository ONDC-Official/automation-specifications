# Retail Grocery (ONDC:RET10 1.2.0)

## Overview

Retail Grocery (`ONDC:RET10`) covers the online sale of everyday household goods: packaged foods, staples such as atta, rice and pulses, fruits and vegetables, dairy, and other daily essentials.

Grocery orders are frequent, local and time-sensitive. Stores usually serve a small delivery radius, stock and prices change often, many items are perishable, and packaged items must carry statutory details under the Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodities) Rules and FSSAI requirements.

ONDC lets buyer apps and seller apps connect through a common, open protocol instead of building separate integrations with each other. A buyer app integrates once with the network and can show catalogs from many sellers. A seller app integrates once and can reach buyers on every participating buyer app.

The seller remains responsible for its catalog, prices, stock, packing, delivery and after-sales service. ONDC standardizes the network messages used to discover products, place orders, track delivery, and handle cancellations, returns and grievances.

This guide explains the groceries journey from a business point of view first, and then covers the API flows defined in this specification (version 1.2.0).

## Participants

| Participant | What This Means |
|---|---|
| **Buyer App (BAP)** | The consumer-facing application where the buyer searches for groceries, builds a cart, pays, tracks the order and raises complaints. It can be a shopping app, payments app, or any app that offers groceries to its users. |
| **Seller App (BPP)** | The application representing sellers such as supermarkets, kirana stores and D2C grocery brands. It publishes the catalog, checks stock and serviceability, prices the order, confirms it, manages packing and delivery, and handles cancellations, returns and replacements. |
| **Logistics Provider** | The delivery partner that picks up and delivers the order. Usually the seller arranges delivery. In the buyer-managed delivery flow, the buyer app arranges the courier and reports the delivery progress back to the seller. |
| **Gateway** | Network infrastructure that forwards a buyer app's `/search` to all relevant seller apps based on domain and city. |

---

## The User Journey

A buyer discovers sellers, builds a cart, pays, and receives the order with status updates along the way. The journey has the following stages.

### 1. Discovery and Catalog

The buyer searches for an item, a category (for example "Atta" or "Fruits and Vegetables") or a seller. The buyer app sends the search with the buyer's location.

Seller apps that serve that location reply with their catalog, which can include:

- Store name, location, timings and serviceable area
- Categories and items, with images and descriptions
- MRP, selling price, unit and pack size (for example 1 kg, 500 g)
- Stock availability
- Statutory details for packaged items, such as manufacturer name and address, month and year of packing, and consumer care contact

**Network interaction:**

- **`/search`**: The buyer app sends the buyer's search intent and location to the network.
- **`/on_search`**: Each seller app returns its catalog for the buyer's location.

### 2. Item Selection and Quote

The buyer adds items from one seller to the cart. The seller checks stock and whether it can deliver to the buyer's location, and returns a price quote.

**Network interaction:**

- **`/select`**: The buyer app sends the selected items, quantities, seller location and delivery location.
- **`/on_select`**: The seller returns the quote, broken down into item prices, delivery charges, packing charges and taxes, along with the expected delivery time.

### 3. Order Initialization

The buyer enters the delivery address, contact details and billing details.

**Network interaction:**

- **`/init`**: The buyer app sends the full delivery address, contact details and billing details.
- **`/on_init`**: The seller fixes the final quote and shares the order terms, such as cancellation and return terms, payment collection details and settlement details.

### 4. Order Confirmation and Payment

The buyer pays online.

**Network interaction:**

- **`/confirm`**: The buyer app places the order with the payment status (`PAID` for prepaid).
- **`/on_confirm`**: The seller confirms the order. The order is `Created` and its fulfillment is `Pending`.

### 5. Order Processing and Packing

The seller processes the order and packs it. The seller keeps the buyer app updated through unsolicited `/on_status` messages.

| Status update | What it means |
|---|---|
| **Accepted** | The seller has accepted the order. |
| **Packed** | Items are packed and ready for pickup. |

### 6. Delivery Assignment and Tracking

A delivery agent is assigned and collects the order.

| Status update | What it means |
|---|---|
| **Agent-assigned** | A delivery agent is assigned. The agent's name and phone number are shared. |
| **Order-picked-up** | The agent has collected the order from the seller. |
| **Out-for-delivery** | The agent is on the way to the buyer. |

The buyer app can request live tracking at any point.

**Network interaction:**

- **`/track`**: The buyer app asks for tracking details.
- **`/on_track`**: The seller returns the tracking link or the agent's current location.

### 7. Delivery and Order Completion

The agent hands over the order to the buyer. The seller sends **`Order-delivered`** through `/on_status`, with the delivery time. The order is now `Completed`.

### 8. Settlement

After delivery, the buyer app settles the order amount with the seller as per the settlement terms agreed in `/on_init`, after deducting the agreed buyer app fee and any applicable taxes such as TCS or TDS.

---

## Additional Scenarios

Beyond the standard delivery journey, this specification supports the following scenarios.

### 1. Buyer Delivery

The buyer app arranges delivery instead of the seller. The seller packs the order and hands it over, and the buyer app keeps the seller informed of the delivery progress through `/update`.

### 2. Out of Stock

If an item is not available when the buyer selects it, the seller can handle it in this way:

- **Error response**: The seller rejects the selection in `/on_select` with an out-of-stock error code (for example `40002`).

### 3. Buyer Cancellation

The buyer cancels the order before it is shipped, with a cancellation reason. The seller checks its cancellation terms, cancels the order, and shares any cancellation charges and the refund amount.

### 4. RTO and Part-Cancellation

If some items are not available after confirmation, the seller cancels only those items through an unsolicited `/on_update`, and the buyer app updates the settlement for the partial refund. If delivery then fails (for example the buyer cannot be reached), the seller cancels the order as Return to Origin (RTO) through an unsolicited `/on_cancel`, the buyer app updates the settlement, and the seller confirms when the order is back.

### 5. Return

After delivery, the buyer can return eligible items (the full order or some items) within the return window. The seller approves the return, the items are picked up, and the refund is settled once the seller receives them.

### 6. Incremental Catalog Updates

Sellers do not need to resend the full catalog for every change:

- **Push**: The seller sends unsolicited `/on_search` updates for changes such as price or stock, and when a store closes or reopens.
- **Pull**: The buyer app asks for only the items changed after a given time, and the seller returns just those items.

### 7. Catalog Rejection

If a seller's catalog has errors (for example a selling price above the MRP, or missing statutory details), the buyer app sends `catalog_rejection` to the seller app with an error type, code and the path of each problem. The seller can then correct the catalog.

---

## Issue and Grievance Management

A buyer can raise a complaint through the buyer app about an order, an item or the delivery. The buyer app sends it to the seller app, which investigates and resolves it.

The grievance process includes:

- **Registration**: The buyer raises the issue, with a description and photos where relevant.
- **Acknowledgement**: The seller confirms receipt and starts processing the issue.
- **Information exchange** (IGM 2.0.0): The seller can ask for more information, and the buyer can provide it.
- **Resolution**: The seller proposes a resolution, such as a refund, a replacement, or an explanation with no further action.
- **Acceptance, rejection or escalation** (IGM 2.0.0): The buyer can accept or reject the resolution, and can escalate an unresolved issue to the next level.
- **Closure**: The buyer app closes the issue once it is resolved.

This specification supports both IGM versions:

| Version | How it works |
|---|---|
| **IGM 1.0.0** | A simple sequence: the buyer opens an issue, the seller acknowledges it, sends the resolution through `/on_issue_status`, and the buyer closes it. |
| **IGM 2.0.0** | Adds information requests, resolution acceptance or rejection, and escalation. An accepted resolution can trigger a follow-up action on the order, such as a replacement or a return, through `/on_update`. |
